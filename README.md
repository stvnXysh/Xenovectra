Virtual Hardware GPU Emulator: a VM or desktop application that emulates GPU compute by mapping shader kernels and data pipelines onto ordinary hardware. It composes CPU threads, host RAM (VRAM emulation), memory‑mapped files, external HDD/SSD, and USB kernel caches into a configurable virtual or external PCIe fabric.
